            <p>As a full stack web developer, I am prepared to align my skills with your business needs. I am skilled in HTML,
                CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelizer, and APIs. With these skills, I can create full
                stack websites with an awareness of user interface design and the desire to create a completed product that
                will drive your business forward. Over the last decade, I have worked in numerous fields from finance to
                legal marketing to education, and this wealth of experience has equipped me with the skills to problem solve,
                work collaboratively with team members, communicate effectively, and manage short and long-term projects.

            <p>
                My interest in web development arose during my current position as a technology teacher in the School District of Philadelphia.
                In these role, I manage nearly 250 students and educate them in the technological and computer science skills
                they need to compete in the 21st century job market. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, reading
                fiction and non-fiction, and cooking. I have a passion for projects that produce a positive and lasting impact
                on society's most pressing social issues.
